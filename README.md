The repo contains code implementation for SARSA and Distributional Reinforcement Learning algorithms using gym environment.
# What is dist-rl
Dopamine neurons are diverse (pessimistic
and optimistic)
During task and rewards test, some neurons
fired the most when reward was greater
than expected while others fired less than
expected
During signal to predict reward, some
neurons fired at highest level as if the
reward was guaranteed while others barely
reacted at all

The distributional RL implementation was inspired by the paper [Will Dabney, Zeb Kurth-Nelson,
